<p>This project was built using the <%= link_to "Twitch API", "https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/" %> and focuses on using the basic CRUD actions with Ruby on Rails to build a functional app where a user can browse <%= link_to "games", "/games" %> and <%= link_to "channels", "/channels" %> and make subscriptions to the latter.</p>
<p>This application used five different models, which are as listed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Channel:
    <ul>
      <li>
      has many subscriptions
      </li>
      <li>
      has many users through subscriptions
      </li>
      <li>
      belongs to a game
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Game:
    <ul>
      <li>
      has many channels
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Language:
    <ul>
      <li>
      has many users
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Subscription:
    <ul>
      <li>
      belongs to a user
      </li>
      <li>
      belongs to a channel
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    User:
    <ul>
      <li>
      has many subscriptions
      </li>
      <li>
      has many channels through subscriptions
      </li>
      <li>
      belongs to a language
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
